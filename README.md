🍏 Apple Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA Model

This project forecasts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
A simple and interactive Streamlit web application is developed to visualize, analyze, and predict future stock price trends based on historical data.

📊 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a time-series forecasting model that predicts future Apple stock prices using the ARIMA model and displays the results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Users can:

Upload historical stock price data (CSV or Excel format)

Visualize trends and patterns

Train the ARIMA model

View and download forecasted results

🚀 Features

✅ Upload your own dataset (.csv or .xlsx)
✅ Data preprocessing and visualization
✅ ARIMA model training and forecasting
✅ Interactive charts and plots using Matplotlib
✅ Streamlit web interface for real-time interaction

⚙️ Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Apple-Stock-Forecasting.git
cd Apple-Stock-Forecasting

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

📈 How It Works

Upload Dataset – The user uploads Apple’s stock price data in .csv or .xlsx format.

Data Visualization – The app displays time-series plots for better understanding of stock movement.

Model Training – The ARIMA model is trained on historical data.

Forecasting – The model predicts future stock prices.

Visualization – Forecasted prices are plotted alongside actual data for comparison.
